# ticket-butler-mono

## Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

## Launch the WhatsApp bot

```sh
npm run prod:bot
```

## Launch the API server

- To launch the API server locally, use:

```sh
npm run prod:api
```

- To launch the API server in a container, use:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

## API

```sh
 localhost:8080/api/tickets
```

- To get the whole list of tickets, use GET method.

- To insert a ticket to the data.json file, use POST method and input into a form-data: title, fromNumber, description(optional) and file(optional).

## How to use the service

1. After launching both the API server and the bot, scan the QR via WhatsApp mobile in the terminal where you launched the bot.

2. Receive messages to the account that the QR code has scanned from. (Somebody has to text a person who scanned the QR code).

3. Test the service with the following methods and check output in data.json file:

- Send a single text message to the account. Expected output will be:

```json
[
  {
    "createdAt": "2023-06-06T02:20:17.054Z",
    "tel": "77057017526",
    "msg": "–ù–µ —Ö–æ—á—É –±—Ä–∞—Ç—åüòÇ"
  }
]
```

- Send a message to the account with 2 paragraphs (Title is the 1st line, description is the 2nd line). Expected output will be:

```json
[
  {
    "createdAt": "2023-06-06T02:20:17.054Z",
    "tel": "77057017526",
    "msg": "–ù–µ —Ö–æ—á—É –±—Ä–∞—Ç—åüòÇ",
    "description": "Test description"
  }
]
```

- Send a message to the account with 2 paragraphs (Title is the 1st line, description is the 2nd line) and attach a document. The upload files are stored in /uploads. Expected output will be:

```json
[
  {
    "createdAt": "2023-06-06T02:44:59.367Z",
    "tel": "85268576166",
    "msg": "Tyf",
    "description": "Test description",
    "fileUrl": "uploads/Ali Zhakezhanov.pdf"
  }
]
```

- Send a message with no text. Expected output will be: "Invaid ticket".

# Assumptions

The endpoint itself is needed to generate a ticket(POST) and fetch a JSON file containing all tickets information. The endpoint requires a ticket information in order to create a ticket. Therefore, the endpoint has to operate with a service that connects WhatsApp client and the API. There is a library called ["whatsapp-web.js"](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) that was used to create a bot which sends requests to the API service. Currently, the service works on a local machine and generates the JSON file locally(data.json). Since it is a test task, the service was deployed locally only. Further development might include adding a database and deployment on a cloud server. After creating a ticket, please check the data.json file to see the output.
